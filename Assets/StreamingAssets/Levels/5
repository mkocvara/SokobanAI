Sometimes, the robot might not perform actions with high reward because it does not know how valuable they are, as they haven't attempted them yet, or even at all, during training.

To help the robot explore more options, we use the <i>exploration threshold</i>. If we set this value to 100, then during training, the robot will have a high chance of randomly trying actions for the first 100 generations. After these 100 generations, the robot will use what it learned more and more in order to win the game.

Because the robot selects some or all of its moves at random during exploration, given the same set of rules, different runs might end in different results. If you feel like you got close, it may be worth retrying with the same rules.

Try raising the exploration threshold to help the robot win the game. At this point, you are also likely going to need to add extra rules and rewards or change the number of generations to guide the robot towards the solution.

If you get stuck and don't know what rules to add, you can open the menu in the top right of the screen and click "Solve level". If you do, try and think about why those rules work.
