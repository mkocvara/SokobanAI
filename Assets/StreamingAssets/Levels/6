Training a model is usually not a straightforward process and sometimes giving too many rewards for a mundane action can cause the robot to be satisfied with repeating it, while entirely disregarding other actions you would like it to take. 

For example, if the robot is well rewarded for simply walking on empty ground, it might be content simply going back and forth between two tile, never reaching the target, or even pushing the box.

In order to demonstrate this, try adding the rule for stepping on empty ground and giving it a medium-sized reward. Press play and watch how the robot behaves.

To solve the level, you will almost certainly need to remove that rule. Other rules may benefit from having their values tweaked to make the desired actions more attractive to the model. Try also adding new rules and changing the number of generations and exploration threshold to help the robot win the level.
