If you got this far, good work. You got through all of the levels that demonstrate AI concepts. In this one, you'll simply have to put it all to practice to solve it.

If you haven't found it yet, there's a level picker accessible from the menu (button in the very top right of the screen). There you can review which levels you solved and return to retry any of them. You can also wipe your progress or load a sample set of rules which solve the level (though you still need to figure out the right number of generations and exploration threshold).

Speaking of sets of rules (or rulesets), in the bottom right of the rules panel, there are two buttons which allow you to save and load rulesets. Your rules are also auto saved here whenever you load a ruleset, click the "Solve level button" or close the game. 

Finally, if you're up to an additional challenge, try to solve this level in no more than 1000 generations. Good luck, and thank you for playing!
