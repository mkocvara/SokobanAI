Under the hood, iut particular type of AI, which powers the robot, uses a <i>Q-table</i> as the "brain" of the robot. The Q-table is a table of values representing how desirable each action (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) is for a given situation. These values are called <i>Q-values</i>. When the robot has choose an action, it searches its Q-table and looks for the action with the highest Q-value. Every time the robot receives feedback in the form of a reward, these Q-values are changed based on it. Thus, a positive reward will lead to a positive Q-value and vice versa.

For example, if the robot finds itself with a wall below it, a box to its right, and the target on the other side of the box, and has been in this situation before, the Q-values for this specific situation may look something like this:
 UP: 		0
 RIGHT: 	10
 DOWN: 	-3
 LEFT: 	0.5

Use everything you have learned to solve the level.
