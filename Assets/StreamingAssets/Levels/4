The robot is called the 'agent', and the game is the 'environment'. 

The agent learns to navigate the environment by taking actions in a given situation and receiving rewards. The agentâ€™s goal is to take actions that will produce the best possible rewards.

Try adding rules and changing the number of generations to help the robot win the level. 

[THIS LEVEL IS REALLY DIFFICULT. EVEN KNOWING HOW THE AI WORKS I HAD A HARD TIME COMPLETING IT. EXPLAINING A BIT MORE ABOUT HOW THE AI LEARNS (SEE LEVEL 3 FEEDBACK) IS A START AND HOPEFULLY FIXING THE DISTANCE CALCULATIONS WILL HELP, BUT THERE'S A CHANCE THE LEVEL'S MAP MIGHT NEED REWORKING.

ANOTHER THING IS IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT RAISING THE EXPLORATION THRESHOLD.]
