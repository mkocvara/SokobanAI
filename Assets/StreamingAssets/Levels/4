In the context of the AI, our little yellow robot is called the <i>agent</i>, and the game level or map is the <i>environment</i>. The agent learns to navigate the environment by taking its actions and receiving rewards. The agentâ€™s goal is to take actions in any given situation which will produce the highest possible rewards.

Any machine learning model is trained on a specific environment (in our case, a particular level). More difficult environments may require more training. For this reason, training large, general-purpose (therefore with  very complex environments) models, such as ChatGPT or most image generation models, is exceptionally challenging due to the time-consuming nature and potential pitfalls associated with errors in the training process.

This level is a little simpler than the previous one and so the AI should be easier to train. Try reducing the number of generations as much as possible while still allowing the robot to win the game. Be careful not to reduce it too much!
